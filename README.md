# open-core: neuron-based processing framework

> Code has to run like the human brain, trillions of individual neurons firing off messages to each other, a massively 
> parallel network with no central control, no single point of failure, yet able to solve immensely difficult problems. 
> And itâ€™s no accident that the future of code looks like the human brain, because the endpoints of every network are, 
> at some level, human brains.

`open-core` is a neuron-based processing framework for Python software. It helps you build massively parallel, 
concurrent and asynchronous code that follows the [actor model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model) paradigm: 
multiple independent processes emitting and receiving signals to and from each other, asynchronously, without the need 
of a central broker or coordinator. Like neurons.

## Design

- Designed over [the actor model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model)
  - Parallelism through multi-processing for CPU bound tasks
  - Concurrency based on multi-threading for I/O bound tasks
  - Concurrency based on Asyncio for network-related tasks
  - Asynchronous [ZeroMQ](https://github.com/zeromq/pyzmq) sockets

## Installation

```sh
pip install open-core
```

## Dependencies

`open-core` will always try to reduce dependencies to the extreme minimum. The current dependencies are specified in 
the `requirements.txt` file::

- **PyZMQ**: Python bindings for ZeroMQ, a high-performance asynchronous messaging library.

Ensure you have the latest versions of these dependencies installed.
